            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Then Iudas which betrayed him anſwered &amp; ſaid: Maiſter is it I? He ſaid vnto him: thou haſt ſaid, &amp; when they were eating, Ieſus tooke bread, &amp; when he had geuen thanks he brake it &amp; gaue it to the diſciples and ſayd: Take, eate, this is my body. And he tooke the cup, and thanked, &amp; gaue it to them ſaying: drinke ye al of this: for this is my bloud (which is of the newe teſtament) that is ſhed for many, for the remiſſion of ſins. But I ſay vnto you, I wil not drinke hence forth of this fruit of the vine tree, vntil the day when I ſhal drink it new
<pb facs="tcp:173744:21"/> with you in my fathers kingdome. And when they had ſaid grace, they went out vnto mount Oliuet. Then ſayd Ieſus vnto them: all ye ſhall be offended becauſe of me this night. For it is written: I wil ſmite the ſhep<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>herd &amp; the ſheepe of the flocke ſhalbe ſcattered abroad, but after I am riſen againe, I will go before you into Galile. Peter anſwered &amp; ſaid vnto him: though all men be offended becauſe of thee, yet will I not be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended. Ieſus ſaid vnto him: verely I ſay vnto thee, that in this ſame night, before the Cock crow thou ſhalt deny me thriſe. Peter ſaid vnto him: yea, though I ſhould dye with thee, yet will I not deny thee: like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe alſo ſaid al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diſciples. Then came Ieſus with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto a farme place (which is called <hi>Gerhſemane</hi>) and ſaid vnto the diſciples: Sit ye here while I go &amp; pray yonder. And he toke with him Peter, &amp; the two ſonnes of Zebede, &amp; began to waxe ſorowful and heauy. Then ſaid Ieſus vnto them: My ſoul is heauy eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto the death. Tary ye here and watch with me. And he went a litle farther, &amp; fel flat on his face and prayed ſaying: O my father, if it be poſſible let this cup paſſe from me, neuertheles, not as I wyll, but as thou wilt. And he came vnto the diſciples, &amp; found the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a ſleepe, &amp; ſaid vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Peter: what could ye not watch with me one hour? watch and pray that ye enter not into temptacion: the ſpirit is willing, but the fleſh is weake. He went away once again and praied ſaying: O my father, if this cup may not pas away fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me except I drink of it, thy will be fulfilled: and he came &amp; found them a ſleepe againe, for their eies were heauy. And he left the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; went again &amp; praied the third time ſaying the ſame words. Then co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth he to his diſciples &amp; ſayd vnto them, ſleepe on
<pb facs="tcp:173744:22"/> now and take your reſt. Behold, the houre is at hand, and the Sonne of man is betrayed into the handes of ſynners. Ryſe, let vs be goyng: behold he is at hand that doth betray me. While he yet ſpake, loe Iudas one of the number of the twelue came, &amp; with hym a great multitude with ſwordes &amp; ſtaues, ſent from the chiefe Prieſtes &amp; Elders of the people. But he that betrayed him, gaue them a token ſaying: Whom ſoeuer I kiſſe, the ſame is he, hold him faſt. And forthwith he came to Ieſus and ſayd, hayle Maiſter, &amp; kiſſed him. And Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus ſayd vnto him: Friend, wherefore art thou come? Then came they &amp; layd hands on Ieſus, &amp; tooke him. And behold, one of them that were with Ieſus, ſtret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched out his hand, &amp; drew his ſword, and ſtroke a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant of the hye Prieſt, &amp; ſmote of his eare. Then ſayd Ieſus vnto him, put vp thy ſword into the ſheath, for all that take the ſword, ſhall periſh with the ſwoord. Thinkeſt thou that I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not now pray to my Father, &amp; he ſhal geue me euen now more then xij. legions of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels? But how the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhal the ſcriptures be fulfilled? For thus muſt it be. In that ſame houre ſayd Ieſus to the multitude: Ye be come out as it were to a theefe wyth ſwordes &amp; ſtaues for to take me. I ſat dayly with you teaching in the temple, &amp; ye tooke me not. But all this is done that the ſcriptures of the Prophetes myght be fulfilled. Then all the diſciples forſooke him, and fled. And they tooke Ieſus, &amp; lead him to Caiphas the hye Prieſt, wher the Scribes and the Elders were aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled. But Peter followed hym a farre of vnto the hye Prieſts palace and went in, &amp; ſat wyth the ſeruants to ſee the end. The chiefe Prieſts &amp; Elders, and all the counſel ſought falſe witnes againſt Ieſus, to put him
<pb facs="tcp:173744:22"/> to death, but found none: yea, when many falſe witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes came, yet found they none. At the laſt came .ij. falſe witneſſes, &amp; ſaid: this felow ſaid I am able to deſtroy the temple of God and to builde it again in three daies. And the chiefe prieſt aroſe, and ſaid vnto him: anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt thou nothing? Why do theſe beare witnes againſt thee? But Ieſus held his peace. And the cheife prieſt anſwered &amp; ſaid vnto him. I charge thee by y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> liuing God, that thou tel vs, whether thou be Chriſt the ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne of God. Ieſus ſaid vnto him: thou haſt ſaid: Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theles I ſay vnto you hereafter ſhall ye ſee the ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne of man ſitting on the right hand of power, and comming in the cloudes of the ſkye. Then the hie prieſt rent his clothes, ſaying: he hath ſpoken blaſphemy, what neede we of any more witneſſes? Behold now ye haue heard his blaſphemy, what thinke ye? They aunſwered and ſaid, he is worthy to dye, then they ſpit in his face, and buffeted him with fiſtes, and other ſmote him on the face with the palme of their hands ſaying: tel vs thou Chriſt, who is he that ſmot thee: Peter ſat without in the courte, and a Damoſell came to hym, ſaying: thou alſo waſt with Ieſus of Galile: but he denied before them all ſaying: I wot not what thou ſaieſt. When he was gone out into the porch another wench ſaw him and ſaid vnto them that were there: This felow was alſo w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Ieſus of Nazareth. And again he deinied with an oth, ſaying I do not know y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. After a while came vnto him they y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſtood by, &amp; ſaid vnto Peter ſurely thou art eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for thy ſpech bewraieth thee. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan he to curſe &amp; to ſwere, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he knew not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And im<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mediately y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Cock crew: and Peter remembred y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word of Ieſu which ſaid vnto him before y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cock crow, thou ſhalt deny me thriſe: and he we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t out and wept bitterly.
<pb facs="tcp:173744:23"/> When the morning was come al the chief prieſts and Elders of the people held a counſell againſt Ieſus, to put him to death, &amp; brought him bound, and deliuered him vnto Poncius Pilat y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deynty. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Iudas (which had betrayed him) ſeeing that he was condemned, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented him ſelf, and brought againe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> .xxx. plates of ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chiefe prieſtes and Elders, ſaying: I haue ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned betraying the innocent bloud. And they ſaid: what is that to vs? See thou to that. And he caſt down the ſiluer plates in the temple, and departed and went and hanged himſelfe. And the chiefe prieſts tooke the ſiluer plates, and ſayd: It is not lawfull for to put them into the treaſure, becauſe it is the price of bloud. And they tooke counſaile, and bought with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a potters field to bury ſtraungers in. Wherfore the field is called <hi>Achel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dema,</hi> that is, the fielde of bloud, vntil this day. Then was fulfylled that which was ſpoken by Ieremy the Prophet, ſaying: and they tooke .xxx. ſiluer plates, the price of him y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was valued, whom they boughte of the children of Iſrael, and gaue them for the potters field, as the Lord appointed me. Ieſus ſtood before the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putie, and the deputy aſked him ſaying: art y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> the king of the Iewes? Ieſus ſaid vnto him: thou ſayeſt. And when he was accuſed of the chiefe Prieſtes &amp; Elders he anſwered nothing. Then ſayd Pilat vnto him: hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt thou not how many witneſſes they lay agaynſt thee? and he anſwered him to neuer a word, in ſo much y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the deputy merueiled greatly. At that feaſt the deputy was wont to deliuer vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people a priſoner who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they would deſire. He had the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a notable priſoner called Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabas. Therfore whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they wer gathered together, Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat ſaid: whether wil ye y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I giue loſe vnto you Barabas
<pb facs="tcp:173744:23"/> or Ieſus which is called Chriſt. For he knew that for enuy they had deliuered him. When he was ſet down to geue iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, his wife ſent vnto him ſaying: haue thou nothing to do with that iuſt ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For I haue ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred this day may things in my ſleepe becauſe of hym. But the chief Prieſts &amp; Elders perſwaded the people that they ſhould aſke Barrabas &amp; deſtroy Ieſus. The Deputy anſwered &amp; ſayd vnto them: whether of the twayne wyll ye that I let looſe vnto you? They ſayd Barrabas. Pilate ſayd vnto them: what ſhal I do the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with Ieſus which is called Chriſt? They al ſayd vnto him: let him be crucified. The Deputy ſaid: what euil hath he done? But they cryed the more ſaying: let him be crucified. When Pilate ſaw that he could preuayle nothing, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> more buſynes was made, he tooke wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter &amp; waſhed his handes before the people, ſaying: I am innocent of the bloud of this iuſt perſon, ye ſhal ſee Then anſwered all the people &amp; ſayd: His bloud be on vs and on our children. Then let he Barrabas looſe vnto them, and ſcourged Ieſus, &amp; deliuered hym to be crucified. Then the ſoldiours of the deputy tooke Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus into the common hall, &amp; gathered vnto him all the company, and they ſtripped him, &amp; put on him a purple robe, and platted a crowne of thornes, and put it vpon his head, and a rede in his right hand, and bowed the knee before him, and mocked him ſaying: Hayle kyng of the Iewes. And when they had ſpyt on hym, they tooke the reede and ſmote him on the head. And after that they had mocked him, they tooke the robe of hym againe, and put his own rayment on him, &amp; lead hym away to crucify him. And as they came out, they found a man of Ciren (named Simon) him they compelled
<pb facs="tcp:173744:24"/> to beare his croſſe. And thei came vnto the place which is called <hi>Golgotha,</hi> that is to ſay, a place of dead mens ſculs, &amp; gaue him viniger mingled with gall to drynk. And when he had taſted therof, he would not drinke. When they had crucified him, they parted his garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts and dyd caſt lots, that it might be fulfilled which was ſpoken by the Prophet: They parted my garmentes among them, and vpon my veſture did they caſt lots. And they ſat and watched him there, &amp; ſet vp ouer hys head the cauſe of hys death wrytten: Thys is Ieſus the king of the Iewes. Then were there two theeues crucified with him, one on the right hand, &amp; an other on the leaft. They that paſſed by reuiled him, wagging their heades and ſaying: Thou that deſtroyedſt the temple of God, and diddeſt build it in three daies, ſaue thy ſelfe. If thou be the Sonne of God, come downe from the croſſe. Likewiſe alſo all the hye Prieſts moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked him, with the Scribes &amp; Elders, and ſaid: He ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued other, him ſelfe he cannot ſaue. If he be the kyng of Iſrael, let him now come down from the croſſe, and we wyl beleue him. He truſted in God, let him deliuer him now, if he wyll haue hym: For he ſayd, I am the ſonne of God. The theeues alſo which were crucified with him, caſt the ſame in hys teeth. From the ſyxt houre was there darknes ouer all the land, vntyll the ninth houre. And about the nynth houre Ieſus cryed with a loud voyce ſaying: <hi>Eloy, Eloy, Lamaſabacthani?</hi> That is to ſay, My God, my God, why haſt thou forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken me? Some of them that ſtoode there, when they heard that, ſayd: This man calleth for Helias. And ſtrayght way one of them ran &amp; tooke a ſpoonge, and when he had filled it ful of viniger, he put it on a rede,
<pb facs="tcp:173744:24"/> and gaue him drink. Other ſaid: let be, let vs ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Helias wyl come &amp; delyuer hym. Ieſus when he cried againe with a loud voice, yelded vp the Goſt. And behold, the vaile of the temple did rent in two partes, from the top to the bottom, &amp; the earth did quake, and the ſtones rent, &amp; graues did open, &amp; many bodies of Saints which ſlept, aroſe &amp; went out of their graues after his reſurrection, &amp; came into the holy City, &amp; ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared vnto many. When the Centurion, &amp; they that were with him watching Ieſus, ſaw the earth quake, and thoſe things that happened, they feared greatly ſaying: Truly this was the ſonne of God. And many women wer ther, beholding him a far of, which folow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Ieſus from Galile, miniſtring vnto him. Among which was Mary Magdalen, &amp; Mary the mother of Iames &amp; Ioſes, and the mother of Zebedes children.</p>

And when he was in Bethany in the houſe of Simon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Leper, euen as he ſat at meate, there came a woman hauing an Alabaſter box of ointment called Nard, that was pure and coſtly, &amp; ſhe broke the boxe and poured it vpon his head.

And the hie prieſt ſtood vp among them, and aſked Ieſus ſaying: aunſwereſt thou no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing? how is it that theſe bear witnes againſt thee? But he held his peace, &amp; anſwered nothing. Againe the hie prieſt aſked him, and ſaid vnto him: art thou Chriſt the ſonne of the bleſſed? And Ieſus ſaid: I am. And ye ſhall ſee the ſonne of man ſytting on the right hand of power, and comming in the cloudes of heauen. Then the hie prieſt rent his clothes, and ſayd, what neede we any further of witneſſes? ye haue heard blaſphemy, what thinke ye? And they all condemned hym to be worthy of death. And ſome began to ſpit at him, and to couer his face, and to beat him with fiſtes, and to ſay vnto hym: arede, and the ſeruants buffeted him on the face. And as Peter was beneath in the palace, there came one of the wenches of the hie prieſt, and when ſhee ſaw Peter warming hymſelfe, ſhe looked on hym and ſaid: waſt not thou alſo with Ieſus of Nazareth? &amp; he denied ſaying: I know him not, neither wote I what thou ſaieſt. And he went out into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> porch, &amp; the cock crew, and a damoſell (when ſhe ſaw him) began a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to ſay to them that ſtood by, this is one of them.

When Pilate hearde mention of Galile, he aſked whether the man were of Galile: &amp; aſſone as he knew that he belonged to Herods iuriſdiction, he ſent him to Herod, which was alſo at Ieruſale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at that tyme. And when Herod ſaw Ieſus, he was exceding glad, for he was deſirous to ſee him of a long ſeaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, becauſe he had herd many things of him, and he truſted to haue ſeene ſome miracles don by him. Then he queſtioned w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> him many words. But he anſwered him nothing. The hie
<pb facs="tcp:173744:33"/> Prieſtes and Scribes ſtood forth and accuſed him ſtraightly. And Herod with his men of war deſpiſed hym. And when he had mocked him, he araied him in white clothing and ſent him againe to Pilate. And the ſame day Pilat and Herod were made Frendes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For before they were at variaunce. And Pilat cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led together the hie Prieſtes, and the rulers, and the people, and ſaid vnto them: ye haue brought this man vnto me, as one that peruerteth the people, and behold I examine him before you, and finde no faulte in this man of thoſe things whereof ye accuſe him, no nor yet Herod. For I ſent you vnto him, and lo nothing wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of death is done vnto him: I wyll therfore chaſten hym, and let him looſe. For of neceſſity he muſt haue let one looſe to them at that feaſt. And all the people cried at once, ſaying: away with him and deliuer vs Barra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas: which for a certaine inſurrection made in the city, and for a murther, was caſt into priſon. Pilate ſpake agayne vnto them, willing to let Ieſus looſe. But they cryed ſaying: crucify him, crucifye hym. He ſayd vnto them the third time: what euill hath he done? I finde no cauſe of death in hym: I wil therfore chaſten hym and let him go. And they cried with loud voices, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that he might be crucified. And the voices of them and of the hie Prieſtes preuailed. And Pilat gaue ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence that it ſhould be as they requyred, and he let looſe vnto them, him that (for inſurrection and murther) was caſt into priſon, whom they had deſyred: and he deliuered to them Ieſus, to do with him what they would. And as they led him away, they caught one Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon of Ciren coming out of the field, and on him laide they the Croſſe, that he might beare it after Ieſus.
<pb facs="tcp:173744:34"/> And ther folowed him a great company of people, and of women, which bewayled and lamented him. But Ieſus turned back vnto them and ſayd: ye daughters of Ieruſalem, wepe not for me, but wepe for your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. For behold the daies wil come, in the which they ſhall ſay: Happy are the barren, and the wombes that neuer bare, and the pappes which neuer gaue ſucke. Then ſhal they begin to ſay to the Mountaines, fal on vs, and to the hils couer vs. For if they do thys in a greene tree, what ſhal be don in the dry? And ther wer two euyll doers led with hym to be ſlayne. And after that they were come to the place (which is called Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery) there they crucified hym and the euyll doers, one on the right hand, and the other on the left. Then ſaid Ieſus: father forgeue them, for they wote not what they do. And they parted his raiment, and caſt lottes. And the people ſtood and beheld. And the rulers moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked him with them, ſaying he ſaued other men, let him ſaue him ſelfe, if he be vecy Chriſt the choſen of God. The ſouldiours alſo mocked him, and came and offered him viniger and ſaid: if thou be the king of the Iewes ſaue thy ſelfe. And a ſuperſcription was written ouer him, with letters of Greeke, and Latin, and Hebrue. Thys is the king of the Iewes. And one of the euyll doers, which were hanged, rayled on him, ſaying: If y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> be Chriſt, ſaue thy ſelfe &amp; vs. But the other aunſwered &amp; rebuked him ſaying: feareſt y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> not God, ſeeing thou art in the ſame damnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? we are righteouſly puniſhed for we receiue according to our dedes, but this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath done nothing amiſſe. And he ſayd vnto Ieſus: Lord remember me when y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> commeſt into thy kingdom. And Ieſus ſayd vnto hym: verely I ſay vnto thee, to day
<pb facs="tcp:173744:34"/> ſhalt thou be with me in paradiſe. And it was about the ſyxt hour, &amp; ther was a darknes ouer all the earth, vntill the ninth houre, &amp; the ſun was darkned, and the vaile of the temple did rent, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> through the midſt. And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Ieſus had cried with a loud voice, he ſaid: Father, into thy hands I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend my ſpirit. And when he thus had ſaid: he gaue vp the goſt. When the Centurion ſaw what had happened, he glorifed God ſaying: verely this was a righteous man. And all the people y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> came together to that ſyght, and ſaw the things which had hapned, ſmot their breſtes and returned. And al his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, and the women that folowed him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lile ſtood a far of beholding theſe things.

And that day was the preparing of the Sabboth, and the Saboth drew on. The women that followed after, which had come with him from Galile beheld the ſepulchre, &amp; how hys body was layd.

For would not then thoſe Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices haue ceaſed to haue bene offered, becauſe that the offerers once purged ſhould haue had no more conſcience of ſynnes. Neuertheles, in thoſe Sacrifices is ther mencion made of ſynnes euery yeare. For the bloud of Oxen and Goates cannot take away ſynnes. Wherfore when he commeth into the world, he ſayth: Sacrifice and offering thou wouldeſt not haue, but a body haſt thou ordained me. Burnt offeringes alſo for ſinne haſt thou not allowed. Then ſayd I: lo I am here. In the beginning of the booke it is written of me, that I ſhould do thy wyll, O God.

And euery Prieſt is ready daylye miniſtring and offering often tymes one manner of oblation, which can neuer take away ſyns.

Iudas then after he had receiued a band of men (&amp; miniſters of the hye prieſts &amp; Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies) came thether with lanterns, and fyrebrands, and weapons. And Ieſus knowing all things that ſhould come on him, went foorth and ſayd vnto them: whom ſeeke ye? They aunſwered him: Ieſus of Nazareth. Ieſus ſaid vnto them: I am he. Iudas alſo which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed him, ſtood with them. Aſſone the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as he had ſaid vnto them: I am he, they went backward &amp; fell to the ground.

If ye ſeeke me therfore, let theſe go their way, that the ſaying myght be fulfylled which he ſpake: Of them which thou gaueſt me, haue I not loſt one. Then Simon Peter hauing a ſword, drew it, &amp; ſmote the hie Prieſts ſeruaunt, and cut of his right eare. The ſeruantes name was Malchus. Ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore ſayd Ieſus vnto Peter, put vp thy ſword into thy ſheath: ſhall I not drinke of the cup which my father hath geuen me? Then the company &amp; the captayn, and the miniſters of the Iewes tooke Ieſus &amp; bound him, and led him away to Annas firſt, for he was father in law to Caiphas, which was the hie prieſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame yere. Caiphas was he that gaue counſel to the Iewes, that it was expedient that one man ſhould die for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people. And Simon Peter folowed Ieſus, &amp; ſo dyd another Diſciple, that diſciple was knowen to the hie prieſt, &amp; went in with Ieſus into the palace of the hye Prieſt. But Peter ſtood at the doore without. Then went out that other Diſciple (which was knowen to the hye prieſt) and ſpake to the damoſel that kept the doore, &amp; brought in Peter. Then ſaid the damoſel that kept the doore vnto Peter: art not thou alſo one of this mans diſciples? He ſaid, I am not.

Peter therfore deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againe, and immediatly the Cock crew. Then led they Ieſus from Caiphas into the hall of iudgement. It was in the morning, &amp; they them ſelues went not in to the iudgement hall, leaſt they ſhuld be defiled, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they might eate the Paſſeouer.

Then ſaid Pilat vnto them: take ye him &amp; iudge him after your own law. The Iewes therfore ſaid vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to him: it is not lawful for vs to put any man to death, that the wordes of Ieſus might be fulfilled which he ſpake, ſignifiyng what death he ſhould dye. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Pilat entred into the iudgement hall againe, &amp; called Ieſus, &amp; ſaid vnto him: Art y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> the king of the Iewes?

Ieſus anſwered my kingdome is not of this world. If my kyngdome were of thys

Pilate therefore ſayd vnto him: Art thou a kyng then? Ieſus aunſwered: thou ſayeſt that I am a kyng. For this cauſe was I borne, &amp; for this cauſe came I into the world, that I ſhould beare witnes vnto the truth. And al y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are of the truth heare my voice.

Ye haue a cuſtome that I ſhould deliuer you one looſe at Eaſter, wyl ye that I loſe vnto you the king of the Iewes? Then cried they all agayne ſaying: Not hym, but Barrabas: the ſame Barrabas was a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer. Then Pilate tooke Ieſus therfore &amp; ſcourged him.

Pilat went forth agayne and ſaid vnto them: behold I bring him forth to you, that ye may know that I finde no fault in him. Then came Ieſus forth, wearing a crowne of thorne, and a robe of purple. And he ſaid vnto them: behold y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> man. When the Prieſtes therfore &amp; the miniſters ſaw hym, they cryed: Crucify him, crucify him. Pilate ſayd vnto them: take ye him &amp; crucify him, for I finde no cauſe in him. The Iewes anſwered him, we haue a law, &amp; by our law he ought to dye, becauſe he made him ſelfe the ſonne of God. When Pilat heard that ſaying, he was the more afraid, and went againe into the iudgement hall, &amp; ſayd vnto Ieſus, whence art thou? But Ieſus gaue him none anſwer. Then ſayd Pilate vnto hym:
<pb facs="tcp:173744:37"/> Speakeſt thou not vnto me? Knoweſt thou not that I haue power to crucify thee, and haue power to looſe thee? Ieſus anſwered, thou couldeſt haue no power at all agaynſt me, except it were geuen thee from aboue. Therfore he that deliuered me vnto thee, hath y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> more ſynne. And from thenceforth ſought Pilate meanes to loſe him: but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iewes cried ſaying, if thou let him go, thou art not Ceſars friend: for whoſoeuer maketh him ſelf a king, is againſt Ceſar. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Pilat heard that ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he brought Ieſus forth, &amp; ſat downe to geue ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, in a place that is called the Pauement, but in the Hebrue tou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g <hi>Gabbatha.</hi> It was the preparyng day of Eaſter, about the ſixt hour. And he ſaid vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iewes, behold your king. They cryed ſaying: away with him, away with him, crucify hym. Pilate ſayd vnto them: ſhal I crucify your king? The hye prieſtes anſwered: we haue no king but Ceſar. Then deliuered he him to them to be crucified. And they tooke Ieſus, &amp; led him away, and he bare his croſſe, &amp; went forth into a place which is called the place of dead mens ſculs, but in He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brue <hi>Golgotha,</hi> wher they crucified him, and two other with him, on either ſide one, &amp; Ieſus in the midſt. And Pilat wrote a title, &amp; put it vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> croſſe. The writing was: Ieſus of Nazareth king of the Iewes. Thys title read many of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iewes, for the place wher Ieſus was crucified, was nere to the city. And it was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in Hebrue, Greeke &amp; Latin. Then ſaid y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hie prieſts of the Iewes to Pilate, write not king of the Iewes, but that he ſayd, I am king of the Iewes. Pilate an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered: what I haue written, that haue I wrytten. Then the ſoldiours when they had crucified Ieſus, tooke his garments, &amp; made foure parts to euery ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diour
<pb facs="tcp:173744:38"/> a part, and alſo hys coate. The coate was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſeame, wrought vpon throughout. They ſaid ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore among themſelues: let vs not deuide it, but caſt lottes for it who ſhall haue it, that the ſcripture might be fulfilled, ſaying: They haue parted my rayment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, and for my coate did they caſt lots. And the ſoldiours did ſuch things in deede. There ſtood by the croſſe of Ieſus, his mother, &amp; his mothers ſiſter, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the wyfe of Cleophas and Mary Magdalen. When Ieſus therfore ſaw his mother, and the diſciple whom he loued, ſtanding, he ſaith vnto his mother: woman, behold thy ſonne. Then ſaid he to the diſciple: behold thy mother, and from that houre the diſciple tooke her for his owne. After theſe things, Ieſus knowing that althings wer now perfourmed, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſcripture might be fulfilled, he ſaith I thirſt. So there ſtood a veſſell by ful of vineger, therefore they filled a ſponge with vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and wound it about with iſope, and put it to his mouth. Aſſoone as Ieſus then receiued of the vineger, he ſaid: it is finiſhed, and bowed his head and gaue vp the ghoſt. The Iewes therfore, becauſe it was the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring of the Sabboth, that the bodies ſhould not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine vpon the cros on the Sabboth day (for the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both day was an hie day) beſought Pilat that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken down. Then came the ſoldiours and brake the legs of the firſt, &amp; of the other which was crucified with him. But when they came to Ieſus, and ſaw that he was dead already, they brake not his legs: but one of the ſoldiours with a ſpare thruſt him into the ſyde, &amp; forth with, there came out bloud &amp; water. And he that ſaw it bare record, &amp; his record is true. And he knoweth that
<pb facs="tcp:173744:38"/> he ſaith true, that ye might beleue alſo. For theſe things wer done that the ſcripture ſhould be fulfilled: ye ſhall not breake a bone of him. And againe another ſcripture ſaith: they ſhall looke vpon him whom they haue pear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. After thys Ioſeph of Aramathia (which was a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Ieſus, but ſecretly for feare of the Iewes) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought Pilat y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he might take down the body of Ieſus And Pilat gaue him licence.

And we are witneſſes of althings which he did in the land of the Iewes, and at Ieruſalem, whom they ſlew and hanged on a tree.

                  <p>COncerning ſpirituall things brethren, I would not haue you ignoraunt. Ye know that ye were Gentils, and went your way vnto dum Images euen as ye were lead. Wherefore I declare vnto you, that no man ſpeaking by the ſpirit of God, defieth Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus. Alſo no man can ſay that Ieſus is the Lord, but by the holy Ghoſt. Ther are diuerſities of giftes, yet but one ſpirit. And ther are differences of adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and yet but one Lord. And there are diuers ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of operations, &amp; yet one God, which worketh al in all. The gift of the ſpirit is geuen to euery man to ede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy withal. For to one is geuen through the ſpirite, the vtterance of wyſdome: To another is geuen the vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of knowledge by the ſame ſpirit.

If I had not come and ſpoken vnto them, they ſhould haue had no ſynne: but now haue they nothing to cloke theyr ſynne withall. He that hateth me, hateth my Father alſo. If I had not done among them the woorkes which none other man did, they ſhould haue had no ſynne. But now haue they both ſeene and hated, not onely me but alſo my Father.
